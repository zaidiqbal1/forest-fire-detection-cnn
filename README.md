# Forest Fire Detection using CNN

## 🔥 Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for detecting forest fires from images. With rising climate change threats, early fire detection is critical for saving forests, wildlife, and human lives.  

## 📂 Dataset
- Image dataset containing fire and non-fire images.
- Preprocessing applied for normalization and resizing.

## 🧠 Model
- Built with **CNN architecture** in Python.
- Trained using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Achieved promising accuracy in classifying fire vs. non-fire images.

## ⚙️ Features
- Fire/Non-Fire image classification.
- Potential for integration with **IoT devices** and **real-time monitoring systems**.
- Extendable for drone/surveillance camera applications.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Improve accuracy with larger datasets.
- Deploy model with Flask/Streamlit for live demo.
- Integrate with IoT sensors for smart forest monitoring.
